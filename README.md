# SSIS-Discord-Bot: Graduation script

> **Note:** For the actual bot code that most will be using, please switch to the `master` branch.


This is a branch of the SSIS Discord Bot that simply does one thing: shows a message that the bot has graduated. The original
creator of this bot (sotpotatis) has now graduated, so his bot user has "graduated" (the user was switched to a new bot user).
This code can be run to set the bot's profile picture to a graduation hat as well as set its status.
